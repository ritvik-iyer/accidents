# US Traffic Accidents 
This is the final project for UC Berkeley's Stat 154: Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning. 

The models produced in this project have been submitted to the class [Kaggle competition hosted here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stat154-final-project/data). 

#### Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the severity of traffic accidents in the United States, using real-time traffic, location, and weather data from around 3 million accidents spanning 49 states. Our objective was to design a binary classifier for severe accident detection.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. The datasets used and created during this project can be [accessed here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BzlvO6ZKXbegKGTDH_BlpqBIvN2WECmj?usp=sharing). Place the training, validation, and test sets in the general `~/accidents` directory. 
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are kept [here](https://github.com/ritvik-iyer/accidents/tree/main/data-cleaning)
4. The models are kept [here](https://github.com/ritvik-iyer/accidents/tree/main/models). To run a model, navigate to the `~/accidents/models` directory and run the model of choice.
